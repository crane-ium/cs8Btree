BIG Issues:
-Remove was implemented wrong. I am in version control fixing it...
 -Might not be fixed in time. But it will be good for later anyways
-No Iterator. Instead I used a function to give an array version of the tree
-Big remove bug somewhere. Since remove was wrong anyways, it should be fixed
 once remove() is fixed.
 -This means verify is unable to verify properly. Until then, verify is
  -commented out.
-Set __head to non-static because of dynamic _min (sizes)

Issues:
-Set static __head with dynamic min/dupes??
-Should there be a find function to find an array of duplicates? In the case that
 duplicates are merely objects that might be equivalent, but hold different data
-Was trying to delete &_data[i]
 -Removed because it makes sense that it doesn't work, but what if this
  were of a pointer type? Then would there be a leak?
   -No, I don't think so, since i delete[] _data, and it should cover
    if they were pointers



Tests:
-Test that no data leaks or is lost
 -Make sure children do not leak!!!
  -Perhaps make a better way to swap the children? Nah
